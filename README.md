# CV Application

## Aims

- Use React and Vite to create an app that will generate a CV based on user input
- Mobile First in terms of design

## Steps

- without CSS get the forms (personal, education, experience) to appear in the display section.
- make the 'new education button' add the three education fields again (and the delete education button?). Also a delete education button in case you add too many.
- designing mobile first, make the app responsive and look good.
