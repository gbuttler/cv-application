# CV Application

## Aims

- Use React and Vite to create an app that will generate a CV based on user input
- Mobile First in terms of design

## To Do

- Get the new education text to appear in the CV display (currently it only shows the placeholder text, even if no new education is added)
- Make the remove education button get rid of the correct section of the form (at the moment it only removes the most recently added)
- Allow the user to add more work experience (same way as education)
- Check the render method of 'App' - I'm getting an error
- style everything with mobile first
